'''
Definition:
Abstraction is the process of hiding complex implementation details and only showing essential features to the user.

ðŸ”¹ Example:
Think of a car:

You only need to press the accelerator to move forward.

You donâ€™t need to know how the engine, fuel injection, or transmission works
